```{r}
#analyzing the GLobal Terrorist Activities
require(data.table)
require(readr) #to read data faster
require(ggplot2)


terror<-read_csv("F:/globalterrorismdb_0617dist.csv")

#checking the structure of data
str(terror)
summary(terror)
#a wide data set with lots of columns

```



Starting with Descriptive Analytics

```{r}
#checking how many terrorist attacks were successfull
table(terror$success)

success<-as.data.frame(table(terror$success))
success$Var1<-ifelse(success$Var1==1,"Successful","Unsuccessful")
names(success)<-c("Attack","count")
#almost 90% of all attacks were successfull
ggplot(aes(x = Attack,y=count), data = success) + 
  geom_col(width=0.5,color="black",fill="purple",alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Attack",y="Count",title="Distrubution of Successful and Unsuccessful attacks from 1970-2015")


```
Most of the attacks in the past were successfully executed.

####Analyzing what types of Attacks were done

Aggregating and summarising data.

```{r}
table(terror$attacktype1_txt)
#Most common terror attack is Bombing/Explosion

#Finding Succcessful attacks and their attack types
#percentage of Successful and unsuccessful attacks
#converting to a data frame
attackdf<-data.frame(round(prop.table(table(terror$attacktype1_txt,
                                      terror$success))*100,2))
#Spreading the data frame
attackdf<-attackdf %>% spread(key = Var2,Freq) 
colnames(attackdf)<-c("Type_of_Attack","Per_Unsuccessful_Attack","Per_Successful_Attack")
attackdf
