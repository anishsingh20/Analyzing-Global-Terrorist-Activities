```{r}
#checking how many terrorist attacks were successfull
table(terror$success)

success<-as.data.frame(table(terror$success))
success$Var1<-ifelse(success$Var1==1,"Successful","Unsuccessful")
names(success)<-c("Attack","count")
#almost 90% of all attacks were successfull
ggplot(aes(x = Attack,y=count), data = success) + 
  geom_col(width=0.5,color="black",fill="purple",alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Attack",y="Count",title="Distrubution of Successful and Unsuccessful attacks from 1970-2015")
